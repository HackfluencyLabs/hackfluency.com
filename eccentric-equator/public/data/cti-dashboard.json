        "description": "Relationship Between Social Media Discussions and Infrastructure Findings:\n- Social Discussion Preceding Infrastructure Exposure: There are instances where social discussions about specific threats or vulnerabilities precede the actual findings of those same vulnerabilities in infrastructure. For example, the discussion around CVE-2026-1731 (outdated exploit) occurred 4 hours before the vulnerability was found on a host.\n- Time Window Between Events: The time window between social discussions and infrastructure findings is generally within 5 days, with some instances as short as 4 hours. This suggests that malicious actors are actively exploiting vulnerabilities in real-time or shortly after they become known.\n- CVEs Being Discussed vs. Infrastructure Vulnerabilities: There are multiple CVEs being discussed on social media platforms (e.g., CVE-2026-1731, CVE-2025-26465) that match the vulnerabilities found in infrastructure scans.",
